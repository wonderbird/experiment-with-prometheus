# Experiment with Prometheus

Experimenting with prometheus and its ecosystem.

This project shows how to run a prometheus server, connect it to grafana and add some services for scraping metrics.

The software in this project is highly experimental. Its only purpose is for me to learn about prometheus and grafana features and integrating them into a docker-compose / kubernetes environment.
